@article{Zhao:2009,
	Abstract = {Multiple-precision modular multiplications are the key components in security applications, like public-key cryptography for encrypting and signing digital data. But unfortunately they are computationally expensive for contemporary CPUs. By exploiting the computing power of the many-core GPUs, we implemented a multiple-precision integer library with CUDA. In this paper, we will investigate the implementation of two approaches of multiple-precision modular multiplications on GPU. We will analyze the detail of the instructions of multiple-precision modular multiplication on the GPU and find the hit issues, and then we propose to use the inline ASM to improve the implementation of this function. Our experimental results show that the performance of multiple-precision modular multiplication has been improved by 20%.},
